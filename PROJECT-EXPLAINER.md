# EIDS Demo Project - Simple Explainer

## What Is This Project?

The **Defense Health Agency (DHA)** is looking for companies to build modern software applications that help manage healthcare data for the **Military Health System**. This is a government contract opportunity called **EIDS AOI 4 - Data Applications**.

**EIDS** stands for **Enterprise Intelligence & Data Solutions**.

## What Does the Government Want?

In simple terms, they want:

1. **Modern, Easy-to-Use Websites** - Applications that look good, work on any device, and are accessible to people with disabilities (Section 508 compliant)

2. **Smart AI Features** - Machine learning that can predict outcomes, understand natural language, and help make better decisions

3. **Scalable Systems** - Must work for 100,000+ users at the same time

4. **Secure & Compliant** - Follow healthcare privacy rules (HIPAA) and government security standards

5. **Analytics Dashboards** - Track how the system is performing and how users are engaging

- **Natural Language Queries** - Type questions like "Show pending applications"
- **Predictive Analytics** - Forecasts completion dates and budgets
- **Explainable AI** - Shows WHY the AI made its decisions (SHAP values)
- **Ethical AI** - Bias metrics and fairness scores displayed

### 4. Analytics Page
- Charts showing trends over time
- Performance metrics
- User engagement data

### 5. Admin Panel
- User management (add, edit, delete users)
- Audit logging (who did what, when)
- System health monitoring
- API metrics

### 6. Accessibility (Section 508)
